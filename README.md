# Getting Started
Otium is easy to use, so we need to include only one header at the top of source file. 
To proper working we must overload a IManager object. We need it, because with this object Otium can load images or fonts, read image and font size etc. 
Your root Widget as Form can be just a ... Widget. This object with no overload doesn't have a look and no handle events. Otium, like rest GUI system, has a node hierarchy.
